      "{'Sarah': (1, [\"I played Survivor: Cagayan, and I have a phenomenal social game. I'm a police officer, so I can read people, and with a season called Game Changers, I feel like somebody will get anxious and feel as though they need to make a move, which will put a target on their back, and then I'm going to be the silent assassin. (laughs)\", \"I told Cirie I'm good with her, but if someone's going to throw her name out, I'm gonna go with it. Last time I played like a cop, look where it got me. This time I'm playing like a criminal, and we'll see where it gets me. My word is not my bond in this game this time.\", \"Tavua, who started literally from scratch, has somehow banded together, and we're just, like, dominating stuff now. But I don't want to be overconfident. In the event that something crazy happens, I need options.\", \"At this point, Troyzan's the odd one out against me and the other four, but the set four, that's stupid. That's boring. I don't like it. Let's grow up. Come on. I'm completely playing this game like a criminal this time. I know how criminals lie to me. So I know how to lie to these people.\", \"The reason Sandra has won twice is because she doesn't come off as the most dangerous person in this game. I almost feel like the way Sandra talks to people is she's grooming us. She doesn't pressure you. Her voice never raises. It's calm. And she just starts to suck you in.\", 'Today, after the reward, Varner starts saying, \"I really want to work with you guys.\" And I think we can pull Varner and actually use him as a number. And I really, truly feel like we have made that connection.', 'Then he says, \"Could Ozzy potentially be the vote?\" So that\\'s what I\\'m thinking of right now. I need to be careful because that\\'s a huge move, but I\\'m ready to prove why I am a Game Changer. We\\'re close to a merge, and we need to take out who is the biggest threat. It might be time to cut Ozzy\\'s throat.', 'Zeke sat him down and said, \"The girls are gonna lie to you just to make you feel good.\" And I\\'m like, \"What?! Why would you throw us under the bus so you could save face?\" Things are starting to look weird now. Zeke doesn\\'t really want to get rid of Ozzy and Zeke threw Andrea and I under the bus. I\\'m like, \"This kind of is starting to stink. Do Zeke and Ozzy have something more going on that I don\\'t know about?\" And that really scares me. This could be a huge mistake, but maybe we need to get rid of Ozzy and keep Varner.', 'You know, I come from a very conservative background. I don’t know any transgender people until now, and the fact that I’ve been with Zeke and gotten to know him as a person from Day 1… I love that guy, and it doesn’t change who he is to me. If anything, it makes us stronger, I feel. So I woke up this morning, and Zeke is Zeke.', 'We lost the Marshalls spa day, and it’s a huge letdown, but I’m finding myself in the middle. I have options. And it’s just going to be which group wants to vote out the person that I want to vote out. That’s where I’m going to go.', 'At this point, I am sitting in the middle of two groups that are starting to surface. The one group, Brad, Sierra, Troyzan, Tai, Debbie, they want to vote out Ozzy, and then there’s another group of Cirie, Andrea, Michaela, Aubry, and Ozzy, and they want to see Zeke go. I’m weighing out all my options, and to vote Ozzy out, that means taking out a big social and challenge threat right now. That’s the move to make early on in a merge. But then, a lot of people want Zeke out, because he’s a smart guy and he’s willing to make moves, and when you trust somebody like that, you will end up getting blindsided. So it’s a real tough position to be in, but a line will be drawn in the sand this vote.', 'At Tribal Council, I had to pick a side, but I still want to work with Zeke. Having Zeke opens up options for me.', 'As much as people want to think that the line is drawn in the sand, well, I hate to break it to people, but the tide comes up pretty quickly, and that line gets washed away.', 'I’m looking over at Michaela, and I see a rolled up piece of paper that says “Secret Advantage,” and I can’t believe Michaela didn’t see that. With Survivor, to be a Game Changer, you gotta be looking constantly for idols and clues, and now I have a secret advantage. So this is a huge win for me.', 'When we were leaving the challenge, I looked over at Michaela, and I see a secret advantage right at her feet. That’s called attention to detail. I’m a police officer, but the normal person that drives down the road would not know if the car in front of them’s registration tags are expired or not… (raises hand) I would.', 'Having this advantage opens up options for me. I can completely flip the game.', 'In the past, these extra votes have not been played correctly. I will be the first one to play this vote correctly.', 'I promised myself coming out here that I will not make the same mistakes I made the first time I played. What I did in Cagayan was look for the safest route I could go. I sat back, didn’t make a move, and let other people make the decisions. That didn’t work, it got me on the jury, and not even close to a shot at a million dollars.', 'There’s small windows of opportunities in this game, and if you miss them, you’re not gonna win. However, this game is all about timing, and I’m not sure the time is right to make a big move, but I’m ready for it in the event that it is.', 'The plan was made without even asking me, and I realized at that point, I’m not high in the pecking order in that sixsome. So it might be time for me to make my move.', 'I had this plan to blindside the power group, and then Sierra proposes this idea that me, her and Debbie are a final three. And I was like, “Holy, crap, maybe I’m not on the bottom of the six at all.”', 'I was thinking, I might want to sit in the final three with Debbie, but now she’s spreading lies about me. At this point, I don’t know what to do. If I can control Debbie, I could be in the top six, for sure, potentially in the final three. However, I swore to myself coming out here, I’m gonna make big moves. Whatever I do, it’s going to determine how far I go in this game. I’m gonna decide at Tribal.', 'Tonight at Tribal Council, I was the deciding vote in which alliance was gonna get the majority of the numbers. You know, this is Survivor, and it’s Game Changers. Hopefully, if I make it to the end, the jury will reward the fact that I was a Game Changer enough to make this type of move.', 'I’ve never been in a helicopter. Super stoked. I get a window seat. Fiji, it’s a dream come true. I mean, it’s insane how many islands and how beautiful they are. The helicopter lands, basically, red carpet rolled out. There’s a guy waiting with drinks for us.', 'When Cirie presents the idea of getting rid of Zeke, I’m definitely not down for it, because I can trust Zeke, so I need to reassure her to keep him in this game as long as I can. I need to fill her in on what my secret advantage is. Typically in Survivor, you don’t want to show your cards, but sometimes it’s necessary to lock people in.', 'I feel pretty good with Cirie. I think it completely calmed her and smoothed over the situation, but in the event that they want to flip the script, I could jump ship next vote and go back and work with Troyzan and Brad and Sierra and Tai, because I want to go with whatever side can get me further in the game. I find myself sitting in the middle, which again, works perfect for me. So I’m going to let the plans develop… and then I’m going to pick a side.', 'I feel good with Zeke. We’ve been together since Day 1. And right now we’re staying with the girls, but at the end of the day, I don’t trust them, I trust Zeke.', 'Just because Andrea’s got a little bit of power now, she’s talking about potentially taking out Zeke this vote. I’m definitely not down for it. I need Zeke for a few more votes, but I really need to keep my mouth shut, because if I start scrambling around to try to save Zeke, I’m going to get in hot water.', 'Tonight is now about Sierra versus Zeke. This vote for our alliance is a huge decision, because right now it’s 6 to 4. We vote out one of our own, it’s 5 to 4. One person flips over, they’ve got the numbers. But at the same time, if I press the issue of keeping Zeke, they’re going to think I have an ulterior motive, they’re not going to trust me, and trust is everything in this game, so I don’t know what I’m going to do, but I have a feeling the deciding vote is going to come down to Michaela and me.', 'Brad and Sierra need to be split up, and when Sierra told me about this advantage, it actually makes me want to keep her now because she’s given me information and she wants to work with me. So the door is opening for her to stay in this game and Brad’s game is over.', 'So originally, I didn’t want to vote Sierra out, but Brad won immunity, and if Sierra goes, it is not all bad, because Sierra has told me about this Legacy Advantage and that she would will it to me if she leaves. Now the only trick is, I need to confirm that Sierra thinks I’m good with her to ensure that she gives it to me. I don’t want to vote her out, but this isn’t about making friends. This is about winning a million dollars.', 'So now, according to Sierra, Tai and Michaela might be voting out Andrea, which is news to me. I need them to help me vote Sierra out, because I need that advantage.', 'Last night at Tribal, taking out Sierra was good, because she told me about this Legacy Advantage. She said, in the event that she is voted out, she’s going to will it to me. So at Tribal Council, as her name comes up, I look at her in shock, like… (shocked face) “I can’t believe you’re going,” and, uh, it worked (shows Legacy Advantage to camera), and Sierra willed me her advantage.', 'And now I have two advantages. The first one is a steal-a-vote, which amounts to two votes, and the second one is the Legacy. So this time, Game Changers, I’m shooting for the stars here, and if I had to pick, I want Andrea gone. I cannot stand the girl. However, it’s gotta be the right time.', 'For whatever reason, Cirie wants to believe Aubry and everything that’s coming out of Aubry’s mouth.', 'So I’m gonna give Cirie the advantage of steal-a-vote to hold on to. This way, if this doesn’t scream loyal, I don’t know what does.', 'I felt betrayed by Cirie at Tribal Council playing my steal-a-vote. So I targeted Michaela because Michaela is Cirie’s right-hand man. But now, I don’t know who I can trust. Fortunately, I still have the Legacy Advantage, which can be played at six. So I know I’m safe.', 'Given the drama that happened at the last Tribal Council, I’m not really sure where I stand with people, and this reward is what I needed. I’ve got to find out who’s willing to go to the end with me, and I’m gonna do whatever I have to do to solidify my spot.', 'I’ve got the Legacy Advantage, and nobody knows about it. So I’m lucky that I’m safe tonight. But at this point, I have to go with people that are gonna take me to the end. I felt betrayed by Cirie at Tribal Council, and Tai, I clearly can’t trust him. So the only choice I have right now is to go with Brad and Troy.', 'The story of my game this whole season is I’m always in the middle. So I’ve got a decision to make tonight. But first, I need to make sure that I can trust Tai.', 'Tonight is huge. This could be a million dollar move. And sure enough, Tai is changing his mind again at the last minute. Tonight is actually the biggest vote of the game. It’s going to determine who will be in the final four. So Tai and I have to figure out which way to go.', 'Brad and Troyzan have been tight the entire game, so, clearly, they’re going to make a move against me or Tai. So when he said, “Let’s vote for Troyzan, and force a tie,” which would come down to a fire-making challenge, I have to consider it, even though it scares the crap out of me. Brad’s pretty cocky right now and thinks he’s calling the shots. But I’m thinking, “Screw that.” If I can win a fire-making challenge, I can decide who’s going to the final three.', 'Tai’s telling me that he can’t win, but he’s made moves and found three idols. So he has a résumé. However, Tai is so all over the place, he might have alienated the jury. And then there’s Troyzan, who hasn’t done anything without Brad’s permission this whole game. But at the same time, he hasn’t made anyone mad. And Sandra won twice by not making anyone mad.', 'If I do this and win, I could rack up a ton of points with the jury, but I have to decide if this is a risk that I’m willing to take. It’s a coin flip, and I’ve got to pick heads or tails.', 'Knowing that I am in the final three is the best feeling in the world. It’s what you dream of when Jeff says the word “Go!” on Day 1. I worked my butt off to get here. I made moves that other people were scared to make. I made moves that I was scared to make. And I’m very proud of how I played. As a police officer, I don’t respect being lied to. It makes me feel like you think that I’m stupid. But I’m the criminal tonight. And those people on the jury are the police officers. So if they’re asking for the truth, I’m going to give them the truth, because I reward honesty. I hope they reward my honesty tonight.']), 'Brad': (2, [\"We've all changed the game, so to win this game, you gotta go big or go home.\", 'In Blood vs. Water, it-it was so difficult. I had my wife Monica on one side and I had my side, but I came on and was very aggressive. This time around, I\\'m trying to let everybody come to me. And I find myself saying, \"W.W.M.D., What would Monica do?\" And I promise you that she\\'d be slow playing this right now. I got a long way to go, but I think I\\'m off on the right foot.', 'This is my new home, so I start thinking, \"Let me make this house a home.\" I love antiquing and I like to decorate. Monica and I spend a lot of-- we decorated our own house. I kind of relax as I\\'m doing that. It kind of gives me something to think about. We\\'re here, meager supplies, meager food, in an unbelievable game, difficult, but I\\'m having a lot of fun because it\\'s 4-2, and I\\'m thinking, \"I\\'m in good shape.\" The four of us Nuku are going to stay together, and it\\'s going to come down to either Hali or Caleb.', \"Truthfully, I wouldn't mind getting rid of Caleb first. Caleb, Debbie and Tai played together on Survivor: Kaôh Rong and that's the threat. I'm trying to bring in Tai and Debbie closer to me than everybody else.\", \"Maybe getting rid of Hali would be a better choice. But Caleb, Debbie, and Tai absolutely have a relationship, and if they wanted to team up, I'm sure they would send me home first, but right now I don't want to be the chief, so I would like Tai to make the decision.\", \"This Tribal is gonna be extremely complicated, 'cause now we're going with them having six against our five. I know that four of us are all gonna vote one way. We have one wild card, Hali, who used to be on death row. However, now the Survivor gods smiled on her and she's in a pretty enviable position.\", \"Today at the challenge, Hali rocked the balance beam, but Debbie couldn't get over it, and we lost the peanut butter. And she was adamant that she could balance, but now she's real angry, so I don't know what she wants. The only predictability of Debbie is that she's unpredictable.\", \"Jeff has thrown us some curveballs this season and this is another one. I end up on a tribe with most people I do not know. I got Sierra-- been with her the whole time. But while I was on the same tribe with Hali, we weren't really tight. And I never had a connection with Cirie. And I never met Aubry and Michaela. But we get Troyzan. Troyzan played with my wife Monica. I'm figuring that could potentially be a connection. He's also a man and I'm a man, and we're the only two men on the tribe.\", \"I definitely think Troy is an ally for me going forward. I feel good with Sierra. I feel good with Troy, but that's only three, and I need a majority of four. So I've got some more work to do.\", \"When Monica and I played Blood/Water, she got all the way to Day 39, and I don't know that I truly appreciated it until I, you know, been here 17 days. For her to do what she did, she's a tough cookie and kind of been a guide for me. I guess (points to Monica tattoo on right forearm) she's been my-my strength and my compass right on my arm.\", 'Cirie and Aubry both came up to me and just said it was so special you said that because they saw the real me and… surprisingly, made us feel closer and really galvanized my relationship between those two. Troyzan, Sierra, and myself have already got a good connection. So I think it solidifies the five people that I have on this side as far as whom I want to go with.', 'In football, you’re only as good as your next game. I made the merge. Awesome. It’s in my rearview mirror. I’m looking straight ahead. Who’s the next person gonna be? It’s not gonna be me. Tai and I connected prior to today on numerous occasions. I think I’ve kinda taken over his Caleb role from last season. So I think I can trust Tai going forward. And on my old tribe, Michaela and Hali were on the bottom, so I want to gun for them first.', 'My number one goal is reconnecting and strengthening the bonds that I had with people that I’ve-- haven’t been with, people that I maybe had a little rocky time with. Bonded with Tai. Debbie, she’s come back and apologized. And with Sierra and myself and Troyzan, so far so good.', 'You know, if I’m just thinking about myself and who I can play best with, I don’t feel that good about Michaela. Her reputation precedes her a little bit, and in the long term, I don’t really trust her. So right now I’m getting everyone together to get on the same page, and Michaela would be the first gobble up after the merge.', 'I think sides are starting to be taken, and you need to get on one or the other pretty quickly, or else you’re going to be on the small side. And it’s going to be a crazy Tribal because it can very well dictate the remainder of the season.', 'Survivor 101: Don’t ever take your whole contingency on a reward. So Troyzan and Sarah got left off on purpose because I needed them to stay to be my eyes and ears back at camp. You got five on the outside, and all it takes is one or two to flip to them having the numbers. I need some people that I can trust so that the five don’t get together and contaminate our six.', 'At this point, I think the six of us are so sick of Michaela that it’s very tempting to vote her out. However, I really think we have a bigger threat to deal with first.', 'Coming back from, uh, Tribal Council, I’m in shock. I was totally blindsided, and, um, six votes to Debbie, five votes Andrea. I clearly was in a great position before tonight. Now I’m-- went from being in pretty good shape with the six to being in terrible shape with the four.', 'Walking off, I can hardly contain myself. I’m going on the reward. I’m going to have an unbelievable meal, but more importantly, I’m with the people I need to be with from a strategic standpoint to change the game. It’s a win-win.', 'That’s music to my ears. I made tremendous headway getting in with Zeke at the reward. So in 24 hours I worked my way up very quickly, not without effort, into a good position. It will bother me if I have to vote for Tai or Sierra, but make no mistake, I am here to win the game.', 'I thought myself, Sierra, Troyzan and Tai were on the bottom and one of us was going home, but come to find, that there was a whole diabolical plan to get rid of Zeke, but unfortunately we all put Tai down. So I don’t know that I have Tai anymore.', 'I’m very fortunate that my loved one is a former stud Survivor player. She’s a huge resource for me.', 'Michaela was kinda, like, angry after she was not selected. So hopefully Troyzan and Sierra are back at camp trying to convince Michaela to flip and get in alignment with us. Otherwise, I have to win immunity for me to be able to make it another day.', 'Michaela’s trying to be a princess and blackmail me into fishing for her. I’m not going to sit here and kowtow to some diva’s demands. I’m just looking for a way for me to get back in this game to be able to make it another day.', 'Tai’s whole game has imploded. He’s been caught in a web of lies. He felt so bad this morning that he wanted to make amends with me and he told me he had two idols. Now, do I really believe him? I don’t know. I haven’t really trusted Tai since he voted out Sierra, but if he’s looking for a home, I can definitely use him for a number. I can help him get further in the game, but I’ve got to have collateral. I manipulated him on the first one, and I’m gonna manipulate him on these two as well. He’s lied to me numerous times. I got no problem throwing him under the bus voting him out with his own idol.', 'Tai informed me this morning he has two idols. That puts Tai in a power position that makes me super leery, because I’ve seen him flip a couple of times. So I need to get back to camp and make sure everybody is on the right page ‘cause I don’t want any funky business with two idols tonight.', 'I won my fourth individual immunity today. Walking into those challenges, I’m so focused on what I’ve got to do that all I think about is the challenge itself. Being a part of the record is a side note. My eye is on the prize and I think I’m really close to being able to take the bell.', 'After winning five Immunity Challenges, I’m clearly in control of this game. I’m in the final three, and quite frankly, I think I can beat every single one of them, but as for tonight, Tai has betrayed me the entire game, so he’s going home, and it’s good to be the king.', 'I knew I was going to win that challenge. I was so prepared mentally, that in my head, I’d already won it before I started. And this necklace makes me Superman, it makes me bulletproof. I’m going to the final three and it’s my decision as far as who’s going home and it comes down to who has done me wrong the most, and that would be Tai.', 'As far as the jury is concerned, after winning five Immunity Challenges, I know that I can beat both Troyzan and Sarah, because after football, I became a trial attorney, so I think I can sell my case better to the jury. So I’m in control, and Tai is going to get what he deserves.', 'The whole day I’ve been thinking about, “Okay, what have I done?” And I feel that I’m in a good position because I’ve been a Game Changer and maneuvered my way to where I controlled my destiny this entire game. I’ve won five Immunity Challenges. I put myself here. I wasn’t drug here. I did it on my own. And I brought the people that I wanted with me here. I don’t need the money, but I desperately want to win. Winning the game of Survivor means everything to me. And I can argue my case at the end of the day and walk out of trial thinking, “I’ve got it. Slam dunk.” But quite frankly, I have not been in a trial on a million dollar case. So, I’m kind of in a trial for a million dollar case tonight.']), 'Troyzan': (3, ['Tony is the biggest threat here. He\\'s probably the number-one Game Changer, and look, I already caught him digging in places like the idol weasel. I mean, like, he\\'s just… (smirks) he\\'s out of control. And then he acted like, \"Oh, hey, bro, what\\'s up?\" (laughs) I\\'m like, I didn\\'t confront him, but he had like-- I can read-- and when he\\'s guilty, he has a fantastic guilty face. But I got to be very careful with a guy like that.', \"Andrea, come on, man. She's-- she acts like she's my buddy, but she's a little devil, that one. She just-- I know she's playing a game. She's-- she's not as clever, I think, as she thinks she is. Come on, I'm 54 years old. I'm the oldest guy out here, and, you know, my intuition is-is good, and I feel like I learned so much from One World. And, you know, I found an idol then when I had to find one. You know, I won an immunity when I had to and changed the game. So this time I will not let any stone be unturned. I'm going to start to at least look for the idol.\", \"So at the next Immunity Challenge, ugh… it's just going to be crazy for me. It's going to be hugely difficult because I have two things to think about, winning a super tough game-changing challenge, plus I also have to find the Hidden Immunity Idol in front of everybody. But if I can do it, it's like a complete 180.\", \"This idol being hidden under this table makes me way nervous, because I'm in charge of untying knots. So I have to wait until after the challenge ends in order to nab it.\", 'To find an idol again is like, \"Oh, I did it!\" And finding this changes everything. It\\'s life for me. It gives you the feeling of power, and power is huge in this game.', \"I have an idol, and Sarah doesn't know anything about it, and she says she wants to work with me. So it would be a huge plus in my game not to play my idol right now. So if I could work with Sarah and keep my idol… I mean, that would be… (makes Ok gesture) the golden ticket.\", 'When Jeff said, \"Drop the buffs,\" I was like, \"Okay, this has gotta be some kind of good luck in my way.\" Being 5-1 on Tavua was tough, even though I\\'ve got an idol, I\\'ve just been sweating bullets all those days. So I thought anything that happens now could be good.', \"Brad seems like a really up and up guy, but I also feel like we're connected because we're just two guys on a tribe with, you know, five women. This takes me right back to my season of One World, and the last thing I want to do is get bamboozled by women again.\", 'Wow, the Immunity Challenge, I guess on a scale of one to ten, was an eleven because I won and I surprised myself. And now there’s a tight alliance of six and we just gotta figure out who’s going home.', 'So at the Immunity Challenge, Brad Culpepper wins. So I’m going to Tribal with my idol, and if I feel like I’m in trouble, I’ll play it.', 'The fact that Brad won was just outstanding. Brad and I, we’re solid as it gets. So if he wins, I win. And I have an idol which I can play either tonight or the next Tribal Council, which makes me feel safe. So I feel like I’m in a good place, but we’ve got stuff to do. We have to win immunities. We have to play Immunity Idols. We have to be smart.', 'Tai showed me his two idols and I’m like, “Holy crap.” I guess in some way he’s, like, reaching out like, “I want to be a trustworthy guy,” but at the same time, he’s still acting sketchy.', 'My alliance is solid with Brad, and Sarah is with us as well.

I have the ability to speak to people openly, and I worked that angle from the bottom to the middle to the top the whole game. I think that’s what helped me because people did trust me, never wrote my name down, and I got to Day 39.

It makes sense, we have six, they have four, why wouldn’t we just pluck one of them off? But my relationship with Zeke has been so out of control.

You know, I mean, that's his area, and it's kind of a slap in the face.\", 'You know, it was like a big feeding frenzy. You know, \"Kel\\'s got beef jerky,\" and they said, \"Look in his backpack real quick,\" and I was standing right there, and I did it. And there wasn\\'t anything in there at all. But still and yet, all I was thinking about, \"If I find beef jerky in here, it\\'s gonna be ugly.\"', \"I'll definitely feel bad about having to vote somebody off. There's some humiliation involved with being the first one voted off.\", \"To be honest, I didn't expect this adventure to be this hard. I find myself just craving food. Doritos-- I want a bag of Doritos more than anything in the world.\", \"I can't wait to get the food you don't have to work your butt off so hard to get. I mean, we have done fantastic on a small amount of food. You get food in us, and we're going to be unstoppable.\", \"The fish that Keith made was excellent. That was like a blessing 'cause we were starving. We were so hungry.\", \"Maralyn, she's kind of like our little song bird and our little cheerleader in our camp, so Maralyn and I have bonded more so than I have with any of the other people. It might be our ages, it might be that we just kind of took up for one another.\", 'Tired. That was a rough one. Cold... rainy... pretty miserable.', 'The mood in the camp is a sad mood, but it\\'s also a very strategic mood. Everybody\\'s thinking, \"Who\\'s thinking what?\"', 'I had slept outside last night, as did Keith. We were the first ones up, so we thought, \"First ones up, let\\'s just get up and go fishing this morning.\" So we cleared everything off the boat, got the fishing rods together. Jerri popped up out of the tent, ran, turned over the canoe and acted like she was going to get ready to go fishing.', 'I just said, \"Look, you know, we were gonna go fishing. You all were asleep. We\\'re going to go fishing.\" And apparently, Keith wanted to have a talk with me, so he said, \"Well, Tina, let\\'s just go walk along the bank and fish that way.\"', \"You have four or five young people playing that they've got so much chemistry that it is almost second nature just to-- woo-- just immediately gravitate towards one another. And it makes me feel kind of like an outsider, which I am an outsider at this point.\", 'It seems to be getting closer and closer. You can see ash blowing in the wind. We have no idea how close it is to our camp, even though we know that it has to cross the water in order to get to us.', \"I mentioned my frustration with Jerri because it's building. I don't know if it's just me. Do other people feel the same way I feel?\", \"There was a little bit of it just wanting to see how strong does Mitch and Colby align with Jerri. And my thought was, if I could get Colby, that would be two of us. And then maybe Colby could talk to Amber, and that would be the only chance that I would have to make it. At this point, I don't have anything to lose.\", \"It's just extremely hazy and smoky, and... it's an interesting morning.\", \"It's not the things you lose, it's just losing. You know, it takes such a psychological hit on your already psychologically tired body, that, for our team, it's definitely the loss that hits us hard.\", \"I'm not their mother. It's not my position to get in the middle and send them both to time out, but to be honest, I think one of the problems needs to go. We can't afford for people not to get along. Jerri makes me feel uncomfortable. You know, you're always walking on eggshells around her, and it's just no fun living in that type of situation.\", \"Everybody here knows the importance of winning today. Everybody. It is a have-to-win day. That's pressure.\", \"You go to one camp or the other, and I'm not sure how that decision is going to be made at this point. It's important for us to get information right now about who's had votes cast against them, because it's probably going to come down to a tie-breaker vote.\", \"Glad to know it's not one of those things that's life-threatening. I felt a lot of relief.\", \"The importance at this point in at five and five, had a huge impact on the Ogakor tribes. If we had gone in at six and four, we would have been picked off one by one, no doubt about it. We're starting off the second half of the game on equal ground. It's a tie ballgame, we're going into overtime.\", 'I don\\'t think it was a deliberate thing where he said, \"I\\'m going to take my matches with me so the girls won\\'t have it.\" He would not do that under any circumstances. It\\'s in Jerri\\'s best interest not to show a real hateful side.', \"It's nice, starting all over, starting on equal ground. And it was important to listen more than you talk, find out what you're up against.\", 'I looked over at Keith and Keith said, \"Tina, I need this one.\" In his heart he must have really thought that he was going to get the votes cast against him.', \"It's the hardest thing I've ever done to come in. Much harder to come in than stay out there, because I've been out there ten hours. I knew for our team that we... I needed to make that decision. So I stepped down and let him have it.\", \"You go into a merger, thinking that you're very much allied with a team, but then, as time goes by, you might find out that there's people that are more deserving, you know? I want this to be on an individual basis, and I want the good guys to win.\", \"Ever since the beginning, the cooking of the rice has been a problem. It was a problem at Ogakor, and the same problem came with us to Barramundi. Basically, what it is, is the rice has to be cooked to Jerri's specifications. It has to be stirred a certain number of times. The lid has to stay on. It has to be... perfect, you know, or... you-you catch it.\", 'Poor little Elisabeth was sitting there trying to cook the rice, and Jerri made some comments about it. It hurt Elisabeth\\'s feelings, because here she is, trying to help the tribe, and then to not be appreciated for it, and to be judged-- that\\'s very hurtful. And I think that right there probably was enough for Elisabeth to say, \"You know what? You\\'ll get my vote.\"', \"The rain settled in here, and it muddied our water, and it's so cloudy that fishing has not been good at all. We've lost all but two of our hooks because we have to fish from shore, and there's a lot of debris on the bottom.\", 'Me and Colby and Keith usually get together and talk about the order. We all agree or disagree on things.', \"And if we don't catch our food, we won't be eating any food. Here on out, you know, it's gonna have to be... everybody working together, catching... crickets, grubs, whatever we can find, in order to have people fishing, and that's no easy task on its own.\", 'I think that our body is so stripped of any kind of nutrition-- you know, I had turkey and mashed potatoes and some bread-- and it\\'s just... it\\'s just going \"rrrr.\" You know, my body\\'s trying to process it, and it\\'s just not going too good.', \"The water has risen considerably from last night, and we're losing ground, and we had our flag on the other side of our tent, and... I had to move it because we don't know how much longer there's going to be beach over there. And we're probably going to have to move camp today, actually. Today or tomorrow, no doubt. The water's risen, and it must be flooding upstream because it's quickly encroaching on us.\", \"Rodger's been out fishing. Elisabeth's been out fishing. I've been out fishing. Has Nick been out fishing? No. He was asked to go fishing, but he said that he's never been before, and he wasn't planning on starting now.\", \"Nutritionally, you know, our body is going into shock. None of us are used to being this weak and not knowing really what to do about it. Um, I know Elisabeth is not doing well at all. She had a very hard time getting up this morning, just making it out of the tent this morning. I'm really concerned about her.\", \"I think it was a fair trade if we can keep the rains away, as long as it's not a torrential downpour. We may get wet, but there's worse things in life than being wet, such as starving to death.\", \"We're using everything that we possibly can at this point. Every little bit helps.\", \"That rice gave me hope that I was not going to have to be out here starving to death for the next 11 days, which, to be honest, that's what I thought was going to occur.\", \"Amber's a sweet girl, but you can't get by just on flying below the radar. She never really proved to me that she could stand on her own two feet. Now, she has proved to me that she's a tougher little girl than I made her out to be.\", \"I walked down the hill and I saw the devastation. And my first thought was, you know, that's our home. Washed away our food, our cooking, our knives, everything. Everything's just gone. And to be honest, I was just really, really mad. I don't know who I was mad at or what I was mad at. I was just angry.\", 'I went on downriver. I think Keith was trying to cross midway and I saw that the current was strong and your adrenaline gets pumping, and-and you just know, I can do anything.', \"We were very hungry. It's the thing that we feel most out here. And there was nothing that would keep me from getting that rice can. It's just survival of the fittest. And I want to eat, plain and simple. I-I want the rice.\", \"There's no good place to hide here. It's very frustrating. Where the heck do we build it, you know? In the river bed where it's gonna flood, or up on the high point where we can get struck by lightning?\", \"I miss my husband and my children more than anything. I'm still kind of a newlywed. I've only been married just a year and a half, and my husband is my very best friend. And I miss picking my kids up from school and having my son happy to see me. And I just miss everything about them.\", 'Whenever I got on the computer, I could not type fast enough. I said, “We won. Of all the things that I wanted to win, this was it. I wanted to talk to you all so... much.” I got a major rush from getting to talk to my family. And I thought, that\\'s enough to carry me through another eight days, easy. “I love and miss you all more than you will ever know, and I will never ever go away again for this long.” I thought, \"Eight more days? Got it beat, girl.\"', 'After I won my reward, the main emotion was sheer joy.', 'I mean my mouth hurt from just smiling the whole time I was typing. Just the few words that we got to exchange between one another, it was just sheer joy.', \"I'm looking at the river, and it's running through our old camp. That is truly amazing.\", \"Whenever we very first started playing this game, we knew that there were some luxuries that we could not afford ourself. One was thinking about family. But now that it's getting towards the end, it seems that, you know, we can joke around a little bit even, and we can laugh about it, and we can keep our sanity.\", 'We see Colby coming up, and along with Colby is this person with a pink sweater on, and it was Colby\\'s mom. She gave us all a big hug, and she said, \"This is a hug from home.\"', \"There is a sense of doom and gloom about Tribal Council. And it seems that the day of Tribal Council, people are whispering and talking, and a little bit of paranoia sets in, too. You don't have as many people to choose from to kick off. You know, there's only four of you, and one of you's got to go.\", \"On Day 40, being here... becomes this overwhelming surprise. I cannot believe that I'm here. Even though I'm a competitor and I came here with the idea of winning challenges, of having an adventure, of doing well, I never thought I could get this far. As this game is coming to an end, I think that I have... evolved, that who I started out as in this game is not who I've ended up as. I have developed more into a strategist, and it worked to get me from 16 to three.\", \"For me, personally, I'm proud of the fact that I'm a woman and I'm here in the final three with two men. And so, I wanted my idol to be feminine in her own way.\", \"It's been a long, long journey, and everything surrounding this game is one big emotional pull, and now, you've only got three days left, and the people that you've shared life with 24-7 for the past 42 days is going to be over.\", \"This last morning, you know, everything seems like the last for the three of us, and it's just... I know it's a game, but still it's sad, you know? It's not just a game coming to an end, but it's the game coming to an end and the three of us leaving each other's company.\", \"Every now and then, you get a glimpse of closure and you get a glimpse of the impact, and you get a glimpse of how significant it is that you've gotten this far. And I can already feel it starting to rise. You know, I can already feel the... anxiety of some sort in my chest, and a warm fuzzy, you know, coming on. And I don't think this is going to be easy. I think this is going to be, you know, one of those times of saying good-bye. And I don't know why saying good-bye is so hard. You know, my gosh, we've been put through the wringer. I don't know why it should be so hard, but, uh... it's hard to say good-bye.\", \"I've got to share the past 42 days with a lot of people who are extremely close to their family. And I think that, you know, I've been guilty of living my life and, uh, trying to be this strong individual who didn't really need anybody and, um... and ver... fiercely independent. And I think for the first time in my life, the Outback has taught me the value of how much your family means to you, and that you really do need each other. And whenever I get home, I want to go back and for the first time really nurture my family.\", \"Usually, when we've left Tribal Council, there's been a wide range of emotion, such as Mad Dog. When we voted her off, that was a sad day at the Ogakor camp. And there were other times that we came back to camp where it just felt awkward. We really loved Elisabeth, and it just felt awkward almost not having her presence there. And there's been some times when we came back from camp, and we were a little happy.\", 'Last night, coming into camp, just me and Colby, I have to say that it was sheer exhilaration. I accomplished something that I wanted to do, and that was to make it to last two.', \"This last immunity, I was a nervous wreck. Had Keith won, I'm not sure whether or not he would have voted for me to stay with him.\", \"I don't think Keith could've made it this far on his own accord. You know, we kind of pulled Keith along. We needed a third as part of an alliance to have a majority vote, and we've kept Keith around for that reason.\", \"I felt joy. I felt peace. I began to feel closure for the first time. I want to spend the day taking some visual pictures, capturing those to take 'em home with me.\", \"I look at Colby. He came here for one thing-- to win a million dollars. He didn't come here to make friends. He didn't come here for any other reason, and his actions show that. He speaks it. He lives it. He's wide open.\", \"I think it's important for Colby and I to break down the camp, kind of as a tribute.\", 'The shelter-- it was built with no food in our system, very, very weak bodies. That day, building that shelter was very, very tough. And to take it down now is almost like saying, \"It was worth it, because look where I am. I\\'m one of the two. It was worth it.\"', \"What it boils down to is did I come here for 42 days to starve, to live in the type of environment that I've lived in, to make those type of sacrifices, to give somebody like Elisabeth a million dollars?

I, I like it that he\\'s saying “Hey, do this,” or, “Hey, do that,” but people are thinking of that as very direct and arrogant. That\\'s the word I\\'m hearing, and I\\'m thinking to myself “Well, they think he\\'s arrogant? Oh my God, I\\'m out of here!”\", \"Well, somebody\\'s gone. So, it\\'s time to think about who are they going to vote for? Why are they going to vote? I\\'ve narrowed it down to four. I\\'m one of them.\", \"We\\'re getting there. We\\'re getting to know each other a little bit more. I really wanna learn a little bit more about Stacey. Because, you know, I voted her off. She thinks it was Rudy. She even came up to me and said, uh, “Yeah, I think Rudy voted me off, but that\\'s okay \\'cause he\\'s next anyway.”\", \"Rudy and I ? it\\'s an interesting dynamic because if he knew I were gay that would be probably really difficult for him, I think. Seventy two years old, Navy vet. I think it would just freak him. But, he doesn\\'t, as far as I know, know that, and I think he feels comfortable talking to me. I\\'m certainly comfortable talking to him. He\\'s an interesting character.\", \"As people get to know me, they learn who I am and then eventually, over time, find out I\\'m gay. I\\'ve never once in my life encountered prejudice based on my being homosexual.\", \"He\\'s, um, really wanting to get fish. Hadn\\'t been able to bring any in, and I think that was really starting to eat at him.\", \"He\\'s interesting, being a virgin, 23, and not, uh, thinking about crossing that line \\'til marriage. Ooh! He\\'s extraordinarily religious, and I don\\'t know that we\\'d ever be, you know, real close as a result of that because we\\'re on such different ends of the spectrum religiously.\", \"Yesterday\\'s competition was great. That was the, uh, pulling the treasure up from the water, dragging it in and getting the mask and snorkel. Oh, baby, that made me feel good. I wanted that mask and snorkel from Day 1 to go get, uh, fish.\", \"This is a pretty good moment for me, \\'cause I knew people were thinking I was just full of caca. It was just... you know, one of those things that I\\'ve been talking about fishing, talking about what I\\'ve been doing all my life...\", \\'I actually think Sean was kind of sad that I beat him.\\', \\'Sean said, “Get something that looks like a fish.”\\', \\'Finally, when I came up with a third one they said, “Good job, good job!”\\', \"My position with the tribe-- it\\'s probably gonna increase as a result of this. I talk about the things that I\\'m capable of doing and this might give them that “Oh, maybe some of what he\\'s saying is true.”\", \"Today\\'s Immunity Challenge day so we\\'re building a, uh... stretcher. Gotta be a strong one. We don\\'t know for what, but, uh... obviously, it\\'s a competition that\\'s gonna determine who kicks somebody out tonight.\", \"Well, having lost the challenge, we\\'ve got to vote somebody out again. That\\'s what happens every time we lose an Immunity Challenge.\", \"I\\'ve kind of prioritized people based on who\\'s contributing, I think, and can contribute most to the competitions. I even wanted to talk with the group about who we were voting for and let\\'s, you know, before we even go, know, so we could talk with the people, but... boy, did that not fly!\", \\'There was conflict there between Dirk and Sue when she was trying to get going and Dirk was saying, “No” and she made fun of his swagger.\\', \"An idea comes up and you can see on people\\'s faces when Sean is negative about it, and then they\\'ll just harp on it and make it... want it even more.\", \"What\\'s happening in my head is, “Here\\'s the conflict. Here comes the dynamics that suck. Here come the people that just shout and don\\'t listen. Here comes the negativity, and here comes the crap.”\", \"Well, I know what the resolution to the conflict that exists right now would be at home, but I\\'m actually planning something different from that that might benefit me, and it\\'s a little sneaky. (laughs) I think I\\'m going to handle this by beginning to develop alliances with some folks to ensure that I move into the next round.\", \"So the, um... alliances have begun, and I didn\\'t even have to do much about it.\", \\'We really could control our fate if we stick together.\\', \"I think we can trust the three of our votes, \\'cause if one of us blows up, trustworthiness-wise, then this whole thing\\'s out the window and it\\'s... it\\'s a free-for-all.\", \\'We got to win this Immunity Challenge.\\', \"So that was all right. The other team won some live chickens with some eggs. So we came back here and I went spearfishing and got us a nice eel. That\\'s the first eel. If I\\'d seen others, I\\'d have gotten others.\", \"This is a yellow-banded sea krait. We find a number of them in the jungle. I haven\\'t seen one down here on the beach. I\\'m hoping he goes for a swim. I might help him. He\\'s awake now. Oh, I\\'m not afraid of snakes. I mean, I don\\'t want to be bitten by something that\\'s deadly, but, no, I used to play with garter snakes, when I was a kid and feed them frogs, and... You know, they\\'re not… They are quick, and it\\'s... and they are... they can move fast, but you can see when he\\'s about to coil up and strike and you can prepare yourself and you can get ready to move before it does. I want to put him in the water \\'cause I want to watch him swim.\", \"We\\'ve been told they\\'re extremely deadly ? immediately deadly, within six hours deadly. Horseflies bother me more.\", \"It\\'s an interesting game, but it\\'s a game, and I\\'ve had a strategy from Day 1. I\\'ve already built an alliance and we\\'re going to work through as best we can right to the end before the free-for-all.\", \"This is an interesting point in the game right here-- right on the verge of the merge. Two nights before we merge, it\\'s an interesting time. Change is coming, as they say.\", \\'It\\\\\\'s funny when I hear \"How come you\\\\\\'re naked all the time?\" I\\\\\\'m naked less than one percent of the time. I\\\\\\'d like to be naked all the time. That would be smarter in this 100-degree weather.\\', \"I couldn\\'t care less whether guys or girls are around. It doesn\\'t make any difference.\", \"Naked isn\\'t sexual to me, and it doesn\\'t... I don\\'t think of it that way, it doesn\\'t faze me that way so, no, I\\'m pretty comfortable naked. \\\\t\", \"I\\'ve been trying to support keeping Rudy from Day 1; I want to bring him along to the next round where... he won\\'t care much and probably will get voted off before, uh... winning. I don\\'t think somebody\\'s in control of our group, in particular. I think... I\\'m in control of... who\\'s being voted off and I think that\\'s all that matters to me.\", \"We\\'re thinking we can do this.\", \"Our camp\\'s way better than theirs just from talking to them. They don\\'t have a living room with benches, never mind a decent kitchen. I think our house is better from what they\\'ve described. We have fish.\", \"Yeah, when we merge tonight, I think it\\'ll be interesting. I think, uh, it\\'ll set up a whole \\'nother set of interpersonal dynamics that\\'ll be fun for me to watch.\", \\'Sean\\\\\\'s ethically against any kind of alliance and I hear Gretchen is similar on the other side and, um... I don\\\\\\'t get it. You know, I-I consider myself extraordinarily ethical and moral and, uh, this has absolutely nothing to do with this. I... it sounds like sheer stupidity to me when somebody says \"Oh, no, I\\\\\\'m not going to build an alliance, and I hope they wouldn\\\\\\'t do that either.\" Uh, you know, I giggle and think, \"okay.\" (laughing)\\', \"They talked about some kind of a negotiation, and I would imagine if the two parties had opposing views as to what camp they should move to that the negotiation might go on-- or might be interesting. But since both parties, as far as we know, want to move to this camp, I can\\'t imagine what\\'s going on on the sand spit.\", \\'So, what they were really doing was coming to the beach and, uh, were moving in with what things they could have gotten together in the five minutes that they had to get together, I guess. I was glad to see that.\\', \"Gervase was great. I beat the hell out of him in a number of games that I\\'ve never played before, and he\\'s, uh, he\\'s good at cards. I think he could have been letting me win. Uh, who knows? He could be playing the odds, too.\", \"Greg\\'s an interesting character. He\\'s young, too. He\\'s 24, and he was, uh, pretty cocky. He was thinking he could go out and get something, came back in with a sea urchin. (derisive chuckling) But that was good, that shows people that he who thought he was a spearfishing person could go out there, no problem, comes from the other tribe and came back in, telling everybody just how difficult it is-- that ups my value even more.\", \"But even though we aren\\'t any longer two different teams, I still have a team. It\\'s going to be interesting because we\\'re not solid. We\\'re solid with one another, but we\\'re not solidly unbeatable yet just by circumstance, because there are only four of us and there are ten people still left on the island.\", \\'She had to go because she... is bright and, uh, is strong and she was a threat.\\', \"As far as who voted for me at the Tribal Council last night... and I\\'m not certain who it is. But I\\'m thinking it was probably Greg who felt threatened by me. But it could have been any of them. I\\'ve only been with them a day or two and I\\'d not brought in any fish. Today, on the other hand I brought in a huge catch. Three rays... They just lapped that up.\", \"I could eat rice for 17 more days. I could eat rice the whole time, but they\\'re loving the fish and it seems to make people feel great, and I squeeze every ounce of credit out of it that I can. (laughs)\", \"I\\'m not sure how Greg sees me. I\\'m trying to figure out whether or not he\\'s trying to build an alliance or pull me in or make me like him in some way.\", \"He\\'s certainly interacted with me in an incredibly interesting way that suggests to me that he\\'s trying something that I\\'m very, very wary of and that\\'s great.\", \"He\\'s manipulative. He\\'s trying to win me over in some way. He\\'s just not going about it in bright enough a way for me. I would like to spend more time with him and get to know him, but... I would also rather have the million dollars than to have somebody like him around to worry about.\", \"Well I didn\\'t think Greg\\'s tape was unusual. I expected that and was excited by it. You could tell she was having fun and knew he would laugh at what she was doing and I was laughing. I loved it.\", \\'Yesterday was cool. We had that Reward Challenge with the bow and arrow and the reward was, the, uh... videotapes from home, and for me, that was way better than food.\\', \\'Outright lying is absolutely essential, especially when you have a host like Jeff, who\\\\\\'s as bold as to ask \"Well, so Sue, tell me, is there an alliance?\" What a question.\\', \\'The last Island Tribal Council when I was talking about, um... \"I\\\\\\'ll be staying around here because I\\\\\\'m providing fish\" was an outright blatant lie. I\\\\\\'m staying around here \\\\\\'cause I\\\\\\'m bright. It has nothing to do with catching fish. Catching fish makes people happy, but that\\\\\\'s not why they\\\\\\'re voting me here. They\\\\\\'re not voting me off because I\\\\\\'m not letting them.\\', \"Rudy\\'s clueless when it comes to fish, and, um, you know, really ruined it. Nobody knew what to do with cooking the fish and so it sits here and it sits half on the heat, and it sits over there and it gets turned over halfway and it doesn\\'t, and so it\\'s half-cooked and overcooked and undercooked and half of the fish, half of the three rays were wasted... and that infuriates me.\", \\'So I was sitting there, just pissed off, really frustrated. I don\\\\\\'t want anybody around, I don\\\\\\'t want anybody near me when I\\\\\\'m frustrated, and people are sitting there, \"What\\\\\\'s wrong?\" and that just makes it worse.\\', \"I probably won\\'t get fish actually for a little while now, anyway, because they need to appreciate it. I\\'m bringing in too many right now. I brought in a bunch yesterday and a bunch today and so we need to take a break and let them kind of hunger for it again.\", \"I\\'m 39 today and I had intended for quite a long time to celebrate my birthday naked.\", \"Colleen was particularly uncomfortable with my nakedness and when she saw me naked, she just made a funny face and put her hands over her face and who knows what that\\'s intended to signal?\", \"Kelly\\'s acting a little odd. She\\'s dressing like the other two that are her age, and I\\'m hoping that Kelly hasn\\'t, uh, shifted trust and-and joined forces with somebody else.\", \"And last night at the Council Sean realized that his vote impacted who gets voted off because we only used... needed to use three of our four allied people\\'s votes to get Jenna ejected.\", \"Now people are talking about planning and plotting and strategy. (chuckles) And it\\'s just so funny. So utterly, utterly, utterly naive that there would be any room left to plot or strategize now.\", \"When I fish is somewhat strategic. So I\\'m thinking to myself it would be a heck of a lot more valuable I guess to me, if I got fish after a couple more folks were gone. And I\\'ll limit the fish that I\\'m getting so that I\\'m not out here working my ass off and people just expect that there will be lots of fish.\", \"There are analogies between my going out to the reef and hunting the fish and my picking off the, uh, tribe members one by one. I\\'ve been stalking them since before we got on the island. Bye-bye, baby. It\\'s a slow, more methodical game here on the island with each of the tribe members than it is with the fish but there are similarities. That\\'s probably the last fish I\\'ll get until there are five. There are seven participants right now and I probably won\\'t bother to get any more fish until there are five people.\", \"If the alliance were to break down and something else happened that I wasn\\'t aware of I would shake those people\\'s hands and say congratulations you, you know, brilliant good job, you got it because you\\'ve fooled me.\", \"I certainly don\\'t judge him for being not married and having kids. I mean, he had one relationship, and then he had another relationship, and he seems to be in a relationship now with a woman where he\\'s had two children, and is working toward a committed, long-term relationship to parent those children together.\", \"Kelly cut her own throat tonight and it was a wonderful thing. She, uh, tried to align herself to the kids her age and was probably trying to look a little, you know, nicer to the other group, but I have a feeling she\\'s got more going on with them than she\\'s letting on.\", \\'It\\\\\\'ll be interesting. She could have consequences. We haven\\\\\\'t decided yet. (chuckles) \"We.\" Hmm.\\', \"Just woke up. I\\'m wet. So, I guess it rained last night, but I slept through it. Today is the... 31st day... I think. All I know is, this is the ninth day till the end.\", \\'It seems like Kelly might be flip-flopping and planning strategies at our expense and that just ticked Sue off to no end.\\', \"It\\'s dawn and I\\'m looking at the yacht and Sean\\'s probably still sleeping. But it won\\'t be long before they come get me for breakfast.\", \\'It was good. It was enjoyable. I just kept eating while they talked and answered questions as I chewed.\\', \"Sean\\'s father came back with a-a bag filled with things for each of us from particular people, and this made it from, uh, the most wonderful woman on the planet-- Valerie. She just printed out the email that she was... had... was having with her husband who\\'s another incredible man-- a close friend of mine-- and it just takes me back to my real world life and, uh, has my brain engaged and rejuvenated and out of these sixteen, whoever they are, people, and into who I am and just knowing what\\'s going on and that\\'s it\\'s back there and what I\\'m about to experience when I go back and, you know, I can last the other whatever\\'s left, seven days, six days.\", \"There\\'s no such thing as... for me, a Tagi Tribe or a Rattana. That was the stupidest thing I ever heard. Or... or any other tribe. It-it never existed and it doesn\\'t exist. It\\'s a group of sixteen people, four of whom were in an alliance with me and a bunch of other ones.\", \"Whatever it takes to win here is the point. Yeah, it\\'s a game, and call it Machiavellian, sure.\", \\'When Kelly said to me, um, \"Are you pissed off at me? It seems to me like you and Sue are pissed off at me.\" Well, that was my opportunity to come in and smooth things, as opposed to be the one who upsets the applecart. So certainly that little tiff between Kelly and, uh, Sue has been coming and plays to my advantage, absolutely.\\', \"Sixth day to the end. Desperate to go home. Really looking forward to enter reality. For me, this maintaining some kind of a thumb on ev... all of these different people\\'s personalities that I care very little about, uh, is exhausting. I\\'m ready for the people in my life that I\\'ve brought into my life, throughout my life. And I\\'m looking forward to getting back to that with a vengeance.\", \"The end of days is what I\\'m thinking about as I lay here on a raft in the middle of the South China Sea on a beach-- in my bed. Yeah, it\\'s very pretty. It\\'s a beautiful, beautiful night. Cloudy, but I like the clouds. I\\'m just looking at the clouds, thinking of going home. Waiting... waiting... with no watch. Having no idea what time it is. Just knowing that time is passing slowly.\", \"It\\'s bizarre to me how people do the things they do-- like how Sue and Kelly are washing each other\\'s back and hair and, you know, laughing, and joking and hugging, and picking each other\\'s zits and all the rest of it right now, after what they went through yesterday.\", \\'Check that out. Look at the road the ant highway, up on the, uh, ceiling of the, uh, hut here. The canvas. Two-lane highway. You can see the ants going in and out. Got a really great view from here.\\', \"The balance of power I don\\'t believe has shifted from me to Kelly, but certainly I\\'ve lost some footing. Kelly wins immunity, and all kinds of things have to change and shift quickly. So it\\'s not as easy to remain a solid alliance in the midst of a lot of flux with so few people.\", \"Time is kind of out of my head. I don\\'t have a clock or a calendar or a watch or anything, but for some reason, I feel really, really comfortable, really good now. I, um, I think it has to do with just how short... how-how little time is left.\", \"I\\'m a wreck. My hair is way longer than I ever keep it. This feels like a mop. There\\'s nothing left. I used to have a muscle here growing. I think I\\'ve lost a good 30 pounds since getting here, but everything\\'s loose. There\\'s nothing that\\'s firm on this body anymore. Basically, I\\'m a physical wreck.\", \\'I was really shocked in the beginning by how few people were planning. It seemed a vacation to-to sixteen people who were told what this was about, who-who saw the logo that said \"Outwit, Outplay, Outlast,\" same as I did.\\', \"When we got to the point where the original four were still here as the final four, that alliance had gone through a number of machinations that changed it from being the original four to almost anybody\\'s game.\", \\'Had Sue not informed me that she had broken the alliance and established one with Kelly, I never would have known it and the two of them would have easily undermined me, and I could have gone at any point if they\\\\\\'d maintained that alliance. So it\\\\\\'s kind of neat, cute, nice, that the final four were the initial four, but it wasn\\\\\\'t a continuous line of \"Ooh, initial four make it all the way through.\" So there\\\\\\'s a different feeling attached to it, not that, uh, sense of accomplishment I would\\\\\\'ve had had the trust been unbreached and we went through cleanly.\\', \\'The last Immunity Challenge was standing there attached to a... an idol. I thought... “Ugh... no chance in hell of me doing that given who I was up against.” I felt I was forcing the game to go on unnecessarily.\\', \"\\'Cause even if I\\'m voted off tonight I think it\\'s the best decision I could have made.\", \"I\\'m hoping that there is little likelihood of my being voted off, but I\\'m not all that confident. I\\'m not really sure. I think it\\'s in Kelly\\'s best interest to keep me here, but I don\\'t know that she\\'ll do that. I\\'m hoping she will.\", \"It\\'s kind of nice to be one of the last two, and it\\'s nice to have Kelly as the other member. I think I\\'m, uh, reflecting a little bit on-on what\\'s happened for the 39 Days. I think I\\'m also thinking a little bit about questions that will be asked by the jury tonight, and how to approach some potential questions. It\\'s an interesting morning, and I intend to stay completely out of the sun and try and do nothing.\", \"I think it might have been cathartic for Kelly to pack things up, organize, and burn some of the stuff we just don\\'t need anymore.\", \"If I get second place I will not be sad. I will be happy that I\\'ve earned a hundred grand, and had a great time here, and played a game that I\\'m proud of, the way I played it, but I want the million. (laughs) I really want the million. Oh, my God, it would change my life.\"]'}\n"

You know, not if you\\'re playing a game called Survivor and the point of the game is to strategize and eliminate people.\", \\'Kelly is really hard for me to talk with about voting and about alliances. I mean, because she could really be in for forming an alliance because you see her now being kind of pulled back and forth, you know? In one way, I think, she feels that she wants to, like, have fun and be young and, like, she said it. She was just like, \"I can\\\\\\'t believe I\\\\\\'m in this group with these people.\" She\\\\\\'s like, \"It\\\\\\'s awful.\"\\', \"My legs are bothering me. I mean, I would be lying if I said my legs aren\\'t bothering me. They-they hurt a lot. I have all these and then, I have these new ones. I can\\'t sleep because they itch so bad. So, I get a scar and then I itch it off and it... and it\\'s just like this never-ending cycle and they\\'re going to be like this for the next three years, you know? And bugs live in them. I mean, it\\'s just awful. It\\'s so awful. I am feeling like I\\'ve been here for 59000 days. The past five days have been the longest five days of my entire life. I miss my old team. I miss my old beach, you know? I am the last Sole Survivor of the Pagong Tribe. I am a dying breed. Pagong gets picked off one by one. That\\'s obvious. Now, I\\'m very confused at where alliances stand, and I think they\\'re confused at where alliances stand. Rich and Sue are promising one thing to Sean... promising another thing to Kelly. Sue and Kelly are promising one thing to Rich... promising another thing to Sean, and then, Rudy just sits back and watch it all happen.\", \\'That\\\\\\'s what\\\\\\'s so interesting about this is, I\\\\\\'m getting to see the breakdown of the Tagi alliance, which is really funny. Everybody is very concerned of the money at this point. Like Sean would say, \"It\\\\\\'s a one-in-six chance of winning $1 million\" and nobody\\\\\\'s going to throw that away.\\', \"This is definitely what happens when you put a big chunk of cheese in a maze and let all the mice go at it, you know? And see who eats who and who scrambles on top of who and I don\\'t want to be any part of it. It\\'s... not a fun game, no.\", \"Today it\\'s raining. Last night was raining, and I think tomorrow it will probably be raining. (chuckles)\", \"Sean is seeing that he\\'s in a little bit of trouble, and he should probably have Rich out there because Rich is going to make sure that I get booted off tonight and not him. Maybe somewhere he\\'s thinking that. He\\'s smart if he\\'s thinking that. I like that. Good job, Sean.\", \"When Sean\\'s dad first came, to the tell you the truth, I almost cried because I started thinking about my mom and I miss her a lot. You know, Sean just gets all the breaks. But, uh, you know, it was good. I felt happy for him and he is the family kid, you know. So, it was, it was good for him. It was nice to have a new face around and stuff.\", \"We all got thrown a bone, which was amazingly, wonderfully great, because now I feel like I can do this for six more days, and I definitely will... I\\'m on a sugar high right now, more than I have been in a month, so I feel like I can do anything right now.\", \\'Kelly-- she was a double agent, so to speak, you know, talking to the Pagong people, really trying to get in with them and then relaying everything we said to her teammates.\\']'}\n"

Wait till you see him now. If you watch Rich the rest of this day watch the arrogance and the swagger he\\\\\\'s walking around with \\\\\\'cause he won that immunity and he knows he can\\\\\\'t be touched tonight. I think Rich is the ringleader... Or if he\\\\\\'s not the ringleader, then he\\\\\\'s second in command. If I have to say, \"Do I know for a fact there\\\\\\'s an alliance, and all this stuff is going on?\" No, I don\\\\\\'t know for a fact, but I\\\\\\'m a smart guy, you know. I can see things and see how things are happening.\\', \"I think Rich-- being the cocky person that he is-- will think that they can get rid of me with three votes. Now, Sean approached me, saying he wouldn\\'t, uh, mind making an alliance, but he said he would only do it if Kelly joined us so it\\'d be a sure thing. So they really only had their three core people: Rudy, Rich and Sue who probably definitely would be with the plan. That leaves four other votes, including mine that can go on somebody else. So somehow we have to work on Kelly and figure out who she\\'s voting for and then maybe Colleen can also vote for that person. So, the best bet is Kelly.\"]'}"
