I miss my old beach, you know? I am the last Sole Survivor of the Pagong Tribe. I am a dying breed. Pagong gets picked off one by one. That's obvious.

I'm not bothered by his, uh, straightforwardness at all. I don't think it's even a problem. I, I like it that he's saying “Hey, do this,” or, “Hey, do that,” but people are thinking of that as very direct and arrogant. That's the word I'm hearing, and I'm thinking to myself “Well, they think he's arrogant? Oh my God, I'm out of here!”\", \"Well, somebody's gone. So, it's time to think about who are they going to vote for? Why are they going to vote? I've narrowed it down to four. I'm one of them.\", \"We're getting there.

Seventy two years old, Navy vet. I think it would just freak him. But, he doesn't, as far as I know, know that, and I think he feels comfortable talking to me. I'm certainly comfortable talking to him. He's an interesting character.\", \"As people get to know me, they learn who I am and then eventually, over time, find out I'm gay.

He's extraordinarily religious, and I don't know that we'd ever be, you know, real close as a result of that because we're on such different ends of the spectrum religiously.\", \"Yesterday's competition was great. That was the, uh, pulling the treasure up from the water, dragging it in and getting the mask and snorkel. Oh, baby, that made me feel good. I wanted that mask and snorkel from Day 1 to go get, uh, fish.\", \"This is a pretty good moment for me, 'cause I knew people were thinking I was just full of caca.

Gotta be a strong one.

That's what happens every time we lose an Immunity Challenge.\", \"I've kind of prioritized people based on who's contributing, I think, and can contribute most to the competitions.

Here comes the dynamics that suck. Here come the people that just shout and don't listen. Here comes the negativity, and here comes the crap.”\", \"Well, I know what the resolution to the conflict that exists right now would be at home, but I'm actually planning something different from that that might benefit me, and it's a little sneaky.

I mean, I don't want to be bitten by something that's deadly, but, no, I used to play with garter snakes, when I was a kid and feed them frogs, and... You know, they're not… They are quick, and it's... and they are... they can move fast, but you can see when he's about to coil up and strike and you can prepare yourself and you can get ready to move before it does.

I'm in control of... who's being voted off and I think that's all that matters to me.\", \"We're thinking we can do this.\", \"Our camp's way better than theirs just from talking to them.

I think, uh, it'll set up a whole 'nother set of interpersonal dynamics that'll be fun for me to watch.\", 'Sean\\'s ethically against any kind of alliance and I hear Gretchen is similar on the other side and, um... I don\\'t get it. You know, I-I consider myself extraordinarily ethical and moral and, uh, this has absolutely nothing to do with this. I... it sounds like sheer stupidity to me when somebody says \"Oh, no, I\\'m not going to build an alliance, and I hope they wouldn\\'t do that either.\" Uh, you know, I giggle and think, \"okay.\" (laughing)', \"They talked about some kind of a negotiation, and I would imagine if the two parties had opposing views as to what camp they should move to that the negotiation might go on-- or might be interesting. But since both parties, as far as we know, want to move to this camp, I can't imagine what's going on on the sand spit.\", 'So, what they were really doing was coming to the beach and, uh, were moving in with what things they could have gotten together in the five minutes that they had to get together, I guess. I was glad to see that.', \"Gervase was great. I beat the hell out of him in a number of games that I've never played before, and he's, uh, he's good at cards. I think he could have been letting me win. Uh, who knows? He could be playing the odds, too.\", \"Greg's an interesting character. He's young, too. He's 24, and he was, uh, pretty cocky. He was thinking he could go out and get something, came back in with a sea urchin. (derisive chuckling) But that was good, that shows people that he who thought he was a spearfishing person could go out there, no problem, comes from the other tribe and came back in, telling everybody just how difficult it is-- that ups my value even more.\", \"But even though we aren't any longer two different teams, I still have a team. It's going to be interesting because we're not solid. We're solid with one another, but we're not solidly unbeatable yet just by circumstance, because there are only four of us and there are ten people still left on the island.\", 'She had to go because she... is bright and, uh, is strong and she was a threat.', \"As far as who voted for me at the Tribal Council last night... and I'm not certain who it is. But I'm thinking it was probably Greg who felt threatened by me. But it could have been any of them. I've only been with them a day or two and I'd not brought in any fish. Today, on the other hand I brought in a huge catch. Three rays... They just lapped that up.\", \"I could eat rice for 17 more days.

And I'll limit the fish that I'm getting so that I'm not out here working my ass off and people just expect that there will be lots of fish.\", \"There are analogies between my going out to the reef and hunting the fish and my picking off the, uh, tribe members one by one. I've been stalking them since before we got on the island. Bye-bye, baby. It's a slow, more methodical game here on the island with each of the tribe members than it is with the fish but there are similarities. That's probably the last fish I'll get until there are five. There are seven participants right now and I probably won't bother to get any more fish until there are five people.\", \"If the alliance were to break down and something else happened that I wasn't aware of I would shake those people's hands and say congratulations you, you know, brilliant good job, you got it because you've fooled me.\", \"I certainly don't judge him for being not married and having kids.
