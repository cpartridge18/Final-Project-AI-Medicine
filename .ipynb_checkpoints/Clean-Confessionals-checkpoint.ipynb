I don\\'t think somebody\\'s in control of our group, in particular. I think... I\\'m in control of... who\\'s being voted off and I think that\\'s all that matters to me.\", \"We\\'re thinking we can do this.\", \"Our camp\\'s way better than theirs just from talking to them. They don\\'t have a living room with benches, never mind a decent kitchen. I think our house is better from what they\\'ve described. We have fish.\", \"Yeah, when we merge tonight, I think it\\'ll be interesting. I think, uh, it\\'ll set up a whole \\'nother set of interpersonal dynamics that\\'ll be fun for me to watch.\", \\'Sean\\\\\\'s ethically against any kind of alliance and I hear Gretchen is similar on the other side and, um... I don\\\\\\'t get it. You know, I-I consider myself extraordinarily ethical and moral and, uh, this has absolutely nothing to do with this. I... it sounds like sheer stupidity to me when somebody says \"Oh, no, I\\\\\\'m not going to build an alliance, and I hope they wouldn\\\\\\'t do that either.\" Uh, you know, I giggle and think, \"okay.\" (laughing)\\', \"They talked about some kind of a negotiation, and I would imagine if the two parties had opposing views as to what camp they should move to that the negotiation might go on-- or might be interesting. But since both parties, as far as we know, want to move to this camp, I can\\'t imagine what\\'s going on on the sand spit.\", \\'So, what they were really doing was coming to the beach and, uh, were moving in with what things they could have gotten together in the five minutes that they had to get together, I guess. I was glad to see that.\\', \"Gervase was great. I beat the hell out of him in a number of games that I\\'ve never played before, and he\\'s, uh, he\\'s good at cards. I think he could have been letting me win. Uh, who knows? He could be playing the odds, too.\", \"Greg\\'s an interesting character. He\\'s young, too. He\\'s 24, and he was, uh, pretty cocky. He was thinking he could go out and get something, came back in with a sea urchin. (derisive chuckling) But that was good, that shows people that he who thought he was a spearfishing person could go out there, no problem, comes from the other tribe and came back in, telling everybody just how difficult it is-- that ups my value even more.\", \"But even though we aren\\'t any longer two different teams, I still have a team. It\\'s going to be interesting because we\\'re not solid. We\\'re solid with one another, but we\\'re not solidly unbeatable yet just by circumstance, because there are only four of us and there are ten people still left on the island.\", \\'She had to go because she... is bright and, uh, is strong and she was a threat.\\', \"As far as who voted for me at the Tribal Council last night... and I\\'m not certain who it is. But I\\'m thinking it was probably Greg who felt threatened by me. But it could have been any of them. I\\'ve only been with them a day or two and I\\'d not brought in any fish. Today, on the other hand I brought in a huge catch. Three rays... They just lapped that up.\", \"I could eat rice for 17 more days. I could eat rice the whole time, but they\\'re loving the fish and it seems to make people feel great, and I squeeze every ounce of credit out of it that I can.

I\\'m trying to figure out whether or not he\\'s trying to build an alliance or pull me in or make me like him in some way.\", \"He\\'s certainly interacted with me in an incredibly interesting way that suggests to me that he\\'s trying something that I\\'m very, very wary of and that\\'s great.\", \"He\\'s manipulative. He\\'s trying to win me over in some way. He\\'s just not going about it in bright enough a way for me. I would like to spend more time with him and get to know him, but... I would also rather have the million dollars than to have somebody like him around to worry about.\", \"Well I didn\\'t think Greg\\'s tape was unusual. I expected that and was excited by it. You could tell she was having fun and knew he would laugh at what she was doing and I was laughing. I loved it.\", \\'Yesterday was cool. We had that Reward Challenge with the bow and arrow and the reward was, the, uh... videotapes from home, and for me, that was way better than food.\\', \\'Outright lying is absolutely essential, especially when you have a host like Jeff, who\\\\\\'s as bold as to ask \"Well, so Sue, tell me, is there an alliance?\" What a question.\\', \\'The last Island Tribal Council when I was talking about, um... \"I\\\\\\'ll be staying around here because I\\\\\\'m providing fish\" was an outright blatant lie. I\\\\\\'m staying around here \\\\\\'cause I\\\\\\'m bright. It has nothing to do with catching fish. Catching fish makes people happy, but that\\\\\\'s not why they\\\\\\'re voting me here. They\\\\\\'re not voting me off because I\\\\\\'m not letting them.\\', \"Rudy\\'s clueless when it comes to fish, and, um, you know, really ruined it. Nobody knew what to do with cooking the fish and so it sits here and it sits half on the heat, and it sits over there and it gets turned over halfway and it doesn\\'t, and so it\\'s half-cooked and overcooked and undercooked and half of the fish, half of the three rays were wasted... and that infuriates me.\", \\'So I was sitting there, just pissed off, really frustrated. I don\\\\\\'t want anybody around, I don\\\\\\'t want anybody near me when I\\\\\\'m frustrated, and people are sitting there, \"What\\\\\\'s wrong?\" and that just makes it worse.\\', \"I probably won\\'t get fish actually for a little while now, anyway, because they need to appreciate it. I\\'m bringing in too many right now. I brought in a bunch yesterday and a bunch today and so we need to take a break and let them kind of hunger for it again.\", \"I\\'m 39 today and I had intended for quite a long time to celebrate my birthday naked.\", \"Colleen was particularly uncomfortable with my nakedness and when she saw me naked, she just made a funny face and put her hands over her face and who knows what that\\'s intended to signal?\", \"Kelly\\'s acting a little odd. She\\'s dressing like the other two that are her age, and I\\'m hoping that Kelly hasn\\'t, uh, shifted trust and-and joined forces with somebody else.\", \"And last night at the Council Sean realized that his vote impacted who gets voted off because we only used... needed to use three of our four allied people\\'s votes to get Jenna ejected.\", \"Now people are talking about planning and plotting and strategy. (chuckles) And it\\'s just so funny. So utterly, utterly, utterly naive that there would be any room left to plot or strategize now.\", \"When I fish is somewhat strategic. So I\\'m thinking to myself it would be a heck of a lot more valuable I guess to me, if I got fish after a couple more folks were gone. And I\\'ll limit the fish that I\\'m getting so that I\\'m not out here working my ass off and people just expect that there will be lots of fish.\", \"There are analogies between my going out to the reef and hunting the fish and my picking off the, uh, tribe members one by one. I\\'ve been stalking them since before we got on the island. Bye-bye, baby. It\\'s a slow, more methodical game here on the island with each of the tribe members than it is with the fish but there are similarities. That\\'s probably the last fish I\\'ll get until there are five. There are seven participants right now and I probably won\\'t bother to get any more fish until there are five people.\", \"If the alliance were to break down and something else happened that I wasn\\'t aware of I would shake those people\\'s hands and say congratulations you, you know, brilliant good job, you got it because you\\'ve fooled me.\", \"I certainly don\\'t judge him for being not married and having kids. I mean, he had one relationship, and then he had another relationship, and he seems to be in a relationship now with a woman where he\\'s had two children, and is working toward a committed, long-term relationship to parent those children together.\", \"Kelly cut her own throat tonight and it was a wonderful thing. She, uh, tried to align herself to the kids her age and was probably trying to look a little, you know, nicer to the other group, but I have a feeling she\\'s got more going on with them than she\\'s letting on.\", \\'It\\\\\\'ll be interesting. She could have consequences. We haven\\\\\\'t decided yet. (chuckles) \"We.\" Hmm.\\', \"Just woke up. I\\'m wet. So, I guess it rained last night, but I slept through it. Today is the... 31st day... I think. All I know is, this is the ninth day till the end.\", \\'It seems like Kelly might be flip-flopping and planning strategies at our expense and that just ticked Sue off to no end.\\', \"It\\'s dawn and I\\'m looking at the yacht and Sean\\'s probably still sleeping. But it won\\'t be long before they come get me for breakfast.\", \\'It was good. It was enjoyable. I just kept eating while they talked and answered questions as I chewed.\\', \"Sean\\'s father came back with a-a bag filled with things for each of us from particular people, and this made it from, uh, the most wonderful woman on the planet-- Valerie. She just printed out the email that she was... had... was having with her husband who\\'s another incredible man-- a close friend of mine-- and it just takes me back to my real world life and, uh, has my brain engaged and rejuvenated and out of these sixteen, whoever they are, people, and into who I am and just knowing what\\'s going on and that\\'s it\\'s back there and what I\\'m about to experience when I go back and, you know, I can last the other whatever\\'s left, seven days, six days.\", \"There\\'s no such thing as... for me, a Tagi Tribe or a Rattana. That was the stupidest thing I ever heard. Or... or any other tribe. It-it never existed and it doesn\\'t exist. It\\'s a group of sixteen people, four of whom were in an alliance with me and a bunch of other ones.\", \"Whatever it takes to win here is the point. Yeah, it\\'s a game, and call it Machiavellian, sure.\", \\'When Kelly said to me, um, \"Are you pissed off at me? It seems to me like you and Sue are pissed off at me.\" Well, that was my opportunity to come in and smooth things, as opposed to be the one who upsets the applecart. So certainly that little tiff between Kelly and, uh, Sue has been coming and plays to my advantage, absolutely.\\', \"Sixth day to the end. Desperate to go home. Really looking forward to enter reality. For me, this maintaining some kind of a thumb on ev... all of these different people\\'s personalities that I care very little about, uh, is exhausting. I\\'m ready for the people in my life that I\\'ve brought into my life, throughout my life. And I\\'m looking forward to getting back to that with a vengeance.\", \"The end of days is what I\\'m thinking about as I lay here on a raft in the middle of the South China Sea on a beach-- in my bed. Yeah, it\\'s very pretty. It\\'s a beautiful, beautiful night. Cloudy, but I like the clouds. I\\'m just looking at the clouds, thinking of going home. Waiting... waiting... with no watch. Having no idea what time it is. Just knowing that time is passing slowly.\", \"It\\'s bizarre to me how people do the things they do-- like how Sue and Kelly are washing each other\\'s back and hair and, you know, laughing, and joking and hugging, and picking each other\\'s zits and all the rest of it right now, after what they went through yesterday.\", \\'Check that out. Look at the road the ant highway, up on the, uh, ceiling of the, uh, hut here. The canvas. Two-lane highway. You can see the ants going in and out. Got a really great view from here.\\', \"The balance of power I don\\'t believe has shifted from me to Kelly, but certainly I\\'ve lost some footing. Kelly wins immunity, and all kinds of things have to change and shift quickly. So it\\'s not as easy to remain a solid alliance in the midst of a lot of flux with so few people.\", \"Time is kind of out of my head. I don\\'t have a clock or a calendar or a watch or anything, but for some reason, I feel really, really comfortable, really good now. I, um, I think it has to do with just how short... how-how little time is left.\", \"I\\'m a wreck. My hair is way longer than I ever keep it. This feels like a mop. There\\'s nothing left. I used to have a muscle here growing. I think I\\'ve lost a good 30 pounds since getting here, but everything\\'s loose. There\\'s nothing that\\'s firm on this body anymore. Basically, I\\'m a physical wreck.\", \\'I was really shocked in the beginning by how few people were planning. It seemed a vacation to-to sixteen people who were told what this was about, who-who saw the logo that said \"Outwit, Outplay, Outlast,\" same as I did.\\', \"When we got to the point where the original four were still here as the final four, that alliance had gone through a number of machinations that changed it from being the original four to almost anybody\\'s game.\", \\'Had Sue not informed me that she had broken the alliance and established one with Kelly, I never would have known it and the two of them would have easily undermined me, and I could have gone at any point if they\\\\\\'d maintained that alliance. So it\\\\\\'s kind of neat, cute, nice, that the final four were the initial four, but it wasn\\\\\\'t a continuous line of \"Ooh, initial four make it all the way through.\" So there\\\\\\'s a different feeling attached to it, not that, uh, sense of accomplishment I would\\\\\\'ve had had the trust been unbreached and we went through cleanly.\\', \\'The last Immunity Challenge was standing there attached to a... an idol. I thought... \\\\x93Ugh... no chance in hell of me doing that given who I was up against.\\\\x94 I felt I was forcing the game to go on unnecessarily.\\', \"\\'Cause even if I\\'m voted off tonight I think it\\'s the best decision I could have made.\", \"I\\'m hoping that there is little likelihood of my being voted off, but I\\'m not all that confident.
